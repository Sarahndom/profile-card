            <h2>My Bio</h2>
            <p>
                Hey there — I’m a frontend developer who loves bringing ideas to life on the web. For me, coding isn’t
                just about writing lines of code; it’s about creating experiences that feel smooth, intuitive, and
                enjoyable to use.

                I’m drawn to the visual side of tech clean layouts, thoughtful interactions, and design that just
                feels right. I enjoy experimenting with new tools and frameworks, learning something new every day, and
                finding better ways to make the web more accessible and engaging.

                At the end of the day, I just love building things that people enjoy using.
            </p>

            <h2>My Goals in This Program</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>My first goal is to strengthen my understanding of core web technologies like HTML, CSS, and
                    JavaScript, and learn how to build responsive, user-friendly interfaces.</li>
                <li>My second goal is to learn modern frontend tools and frameworks such as React, and understand how to
                    work efficiently with APIs and real-world projects.</li>
                <li>My third goal is to connect with other developers, share ideas, and gain mentorship that will help
                    me grow into a confident and creative web developer.</li>

            <h2>Areas of Low Confidence</h2>
            <p>

                One area I'm still building confidence in is JavaScript — especially when it comes to problem-solving
                and writing more efficient code.
                I'm hoping to improve this by practicing regularly, working on small projects, and learning from other
                developers’ code to understand different approaches and best practices

            <h2>Note to My Future Self</h2>
            <blockquote>
                "Dear future me, I hope you remember how far you've come and how much you've grown since you started
                this journey.
                Don't forget the excitement you felt when you wrote your first lines of code, or the determination that
                kept you going when things got tough.
                Keep learning, stay curious, and never lose the passion that made you fall in love with building for the
                web in the first place." </blockquote>

        <section data-testid="test-about-extra">
            <h2>Extra Thoughts</h2>
            <p>

                I'm really enjoying the process of learning and growing as a developer. Every challenge teaches me
                something new, and I’m learning to be patient with myself as I improve.
                It’s exciting to see how small bits of progress add up over time. I’m looking forward to continuing this
                journey and building projects that I can be proud of.
